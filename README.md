# Quarto Dashboards

With the release of [Quarto 1.4](https://quarto.org/docs/blog/posts/2024-01-24-1.4-release/) it is now possible to create [Quarto dashboards](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/). With this feature it is easy to create interactive dashboards using R, Python, Julia and Observable. 

***

On this repo I have created some example dashboards to demonstrate the possibilities of Quarto dashboards. The examples are in the dashboards folder:

- Gapminder_dashboard.qmd: Dashboard of the [gapminder](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gapminder/readme/README.html) dataset;
- SleepHealth_Lifestyle_dashboard.qmd: Dashboard of a Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset);
- dashboard_penguins.qmd: Dashboard of the [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) dataset.
